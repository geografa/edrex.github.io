The current version this site (my homepage) is based on [reusable Jekyll template](https://github.com/edrex/reusable-jekyll-site), a quick-start skeleton for Github Pages with Bootstrap 3 and some [Prose](http://prose.io/) integrations. 

**However:** I  am experimenting with swapping out parts of this stack

 - (Bootstrap → Foundation),
 - (Jekyll → Docpad),
 - (_ → Grunt)

This research will likely lead to a new release of the site, along with a new skeleton.

For upcoming/planned/WIP changes, see [TODO.md](/TODO) [meta: relative links in Jekyll are super awkward]
