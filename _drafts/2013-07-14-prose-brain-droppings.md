These are the things that have been running through my head in the last 24 hours:

Prose with non-github API, specifically Gitlab?

 * Probably could be done by creating a gitlab version of github.js with the same interface
 
Is codemirror's mobile support going to improve? Is ACE better?

 * Text selection doesn't work (normally in android you initiate text selection by double-tapping).
